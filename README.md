# Federated-Multi-Task-Learning-for-IoT-Sensor-Data

A privacy-preserving deep learning framework that performs simultaneous classification and regression on distributed IoT device data using Federated Averaging (FedAvg).

🚀 Overview

This project implements a multi-task federated learning setup where IoT clients train locally on their data and share only model weights—not raw samples.
A shared encoder learns global device patterns, while two task-specific heads perform:

Device Family Classification

Magnitude Regression

🧠 Key Features

Federated architecture using central aggregation + decentralized client training

Unified shared encoder for representation learning

Task-specific loss balancing for stable joint optimization

Scaled vs. real-value regression handling

Automatic reporting of metrics and sample predictions

📊 Model Performance

Classification

High accuracy across all IoT families (consistent convergence across rounds)

Regression (Real Scale)

Scaled MSE: 0.00051

MAE: 0.2418

Predictions typically within ≤ 0.2–0.3 of true magnitude values

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python, PyTorch

Federated Averaging (FedAvg)

NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib for reporting

📌 How It Works

Data is split into multiple IoT "clients"

Each client trains the shared encoder + two heads locally

Server aggregates weights using FedAvg

Global model is distributed back to clients

After multiple rounds → final global model + task metrics

✔️ Outcome

A compact, federated, privacy-preserving multi-task pipeline that performs reliably on IoT sensor workloads with low regression error and high classification accuracy.
